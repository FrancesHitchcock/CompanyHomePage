                            <p>Hi, I'm Frances and I'm the creator of <span class="repast">Repast!</span> and all its recipes. I have always been interested in health and nutrition. Realising that our typical British diet based on refined carbs, sugar and processed foods is fuelling an obesity epidemic, I began to look at my own eating habits.</p>
                            <p>I decided to try a different type of eating based on high nutrient, high fibre foods such as fruit and vegetables, beans and lentils, nuts, seeds, whole grains and healthy oils with some fish, meat and dairy. Surprised at how delicious this natural food was I started to create and record my own recipes. And here they are for everyone to enjoy!</p>

                            <h3>Stephen</h3>
                            <p>In his day-job as a Mathematician and Computer Scientist, Stephen has less time to cook food than to eat it, so he was happy to take on the position of <span class="repast">Repast!</span>'s CTO (Chief Tasting Officer) and Quality Controller. Stephen knows which side his bread is buttered and enjoys a wide variety of foods. He especially enjoys cheese, with a preference for the creamy blues. Lucky for him that a daily 40gram portion of cheese is recommended by <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320249" target="_blank">Medical News Today</a> as part of a healthy diet.</p>
                            <p>Could good food be a key to academic success? This article published by the psychiatry organisation <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01443-2" target="_blank">Nature.com</a> would suggest so.</p>
